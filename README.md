## Description

The Cms Module contains all the necessary functionalities to build a new Cms system.

## Installation

If you want to add this module to your project, you can use the `joshbrw/laravel-module-installer` package.

Laraplate-cms is dependent on laraplate-core. Add both the repositories to your `composer.json` file:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://github.com/swolley/laraplate-core.git"
    },
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://github.com/swolley/laraplate-cms.git"
    }
]
```

```bash
composer require joshbrw/laravel-module-installer swolley/laraplate-core swolley/laraplate-cms
```

Then, you can install the module by running the following command:

```bash
php artisan module:install Core
php artisan module:install Cms
```
